# VR Evacuation Planning Software
Here is a VR evacuation simulation that I developed which allows users to both plan (not really, still in development) out and practice (can def. practice) evacuation procedures. With the use of the HTC Vive and controller peripherals, the user is able to immerse themselves into a simulated environment, seeing through the headset and manipulating objects in the virtual world through the controllers. Within the simulation, the user will be dealing with constructed emergency scenarios, making use of the HTC Vive controllers to interact with the virtual world in terms of movement and object interaction. From fire propagation to unique escape routes, this simulation gives the user an unforgettable experience which can benefit them for the good.

To check out the simulation you need to have a HTC VIVE VR set, download the Unity project, click play, and enjoy my janky game. 
if you dont have a VR set just click the YouTube link to see the demo: https://youtu.be/_oRFF4QUeFI
